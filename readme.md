# CyberVantage

**CyberVantage** is an educational web platform designed to teach school students about spam emails, phishing, and basic cyber safety in a fun and interactive way.

## 📚 Project Overview

The project is divided into **four phases**:  
1. **Learning** – Learn about spam emails through slides and MCQs.  
2. **Simulation** – Experience safe, AI-generated spam emails and test your skills.  
3. **Analysis** – Get personalized feedback and learning paths based on your performance.  
4. **Final Assignment** – Create your own fake spam email and let AI rate its realism.
